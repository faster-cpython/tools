# Symbolic execution of Python bytecode

This is a learning experiment
where I'm trying to explore
if we have sufficient metadata
to auto-generate mark_stacks().

The main file is (symex.py)[file:symex.py], which contains:

- `Instruction`: class representing a bytecode instruction
- `parse_bytecodes()`: return a list of `Instruction` for a code object
- `Execution`: class holding state during symbolic execution
- `run()`: do everything for one code object
- `main()`: CLI to process all or selected code objects in files/folders

Other files:

- (opcode_metadata.py)[file:opcode_metadata.py]:
  Metadata generated by `Tools/cases_generator/generate_cases.py`
- (forallcode.py)[file:forallcode.py]:
  Helper to extract code objects from files, tarballs, and folders
- (sample.py)[file:sample.py]:
  Default test input for `symex.py`
