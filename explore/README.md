# Symbolic execution of Python bytecode

This is a learning experiment
where I'm trying to explore
if we have sufficient metadata
to auto-generate (most of) `mark_stacks()`.

The main file is [symex.py](symex.py), which contains:

- `Instruction`: class representing a bytecode instruction
- `parse_bytecodes()`: return a list of `Instruction` for a code object
- `Execution`: class holding state during symbolic execution
- `run()`: do everything for one code object
- `main()`: CLI to process all or selected code objects in files/folders

Other files:

- [opcode_metadata.py](opcode_metadata.py):
  Metadata generated by (as yet umerged code in)
  [Tools/cases_generator/generate_cases.py](https://github.com/gvanrossum/cpython/blob/py-metadata/Tools/cases_generator/generate_cases.py)
  in the [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) repo
- [forallcode.py](forallcode.py):
  Helper to extract code objects from files, tarballs, and folders
- [sample.py](sample.py):
  Default test input for `symex.py`
